## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project got me a lot more familiarized with relative/absolute positioning and in particular using the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` properties on elements that are relatively positioned. In addition, I used z-index to achieve the shadow/box effects. I also learned how to use JavaScript to create the accordion effect by toggling an `active` class to show/hide the content, in addition to adding/removing a class to rotate the arrow for the respective item and changing the font-weight when an item is clicked. I initially wanted each item to be a button but ended up scrapping the idea because of issues with styling.

### Continued development

I want to try building the accordion component without the use of JavaScript as the challenge suggests. I want to see how the image scales on different screen sizes since I struggled with resizing the image/background to achieve a similar look to the mockup.

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp How to Build an Accordion Menu](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-an-accordion-menu-using-html-css-and-javascript/) - I followed this tutorial to build my accordion menu.
- [MDN position article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) - This MDN page helped me understand the position property and how the top/left/etc properties affect the position of an element.
